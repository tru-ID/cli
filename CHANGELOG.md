## 0.4.0 (2020-12-07)

### Features

* `simchecks` topic added
    * `simchecks:create {phone_number}` - to create a a SIMCheck for given phone number
    * `simchecks:list` - to search existing SIMChecks
* `subscriberchecks` topic added
    * `subscriberchecks:create {phone_number}` - to create a a SubscriberCheck for given phone number
    * `subscriberchecks:create {phone_number} --workflow` - to create a a SubscriberCheck for given phone number and test via the CLI using a QR Code
    * `subscriberchecks:create {phone_number} --quickstart` - combines creating a project and running a SubscriberCheck in `--workflow` mode
    * `subscriberchecks:list` - to search existing SubscriberChecks
* The CLI now passes a short-lived access token and check_id to the QR Code handler web app so the result of the check can be shown in the browser
* Upon running `--workflow` commands the access token is reused for Check queries rather than creating a new access token for each request.

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

* The package name has changed from `tru-cli` to `@tru_id/cli`. Due to this change (which results in a `tru` binary permissions problem) you will need to uninstall the existing CLI before installing v0.4.0: `npm uninstall -g tru-cli && npm install -g @tru_id/cli`
* The location of the CLI config file has changed to reflect the package name: the location is now `{config_directory_path}/@tru_id/cli/config.json`. See [Oclif config](https://oclif.io/docs/config) for more information on the `{config_directory_path}`. Upon running any command for v0.4.0 of the CLI for the first time you will be prompted for your credentials and data residency. These can be found via https://tru.id/console.
